An object is a software unit that is produced according to a unique class specification.
It is called an instance of its class.
The process of creating it is called instantiating the class.

A java class consists of three kinds of members
    1. Fields
    2. Methods
    3. Constructors

The fields hold the data for class objects
The methods hold the statements that are executed by the object
The constructor holds the code that initializes the object's fields


Specifying what an object can do, without specifying how it does it is an abstraction.

Concealing the implementation of a method from the clients who use the method is called information hiding.
